Don't add sugar to your coffee or tea.
Keep up with your routine - or add new structure to your day.
If you aren't confident, fake it. It will come.
When you walk, look straight ahead, not at your feet.
Get out of your comfort zone - feel a sense of achievement from this.
Make a motivational playlist.
Be listened to - have a chat and get it off your chest.
Drink one bottle of beer or other delicious drink.
